## HACK 2: Unblock Google Lens
To unblock google lens, go to [LearnWork Lens](https://stuffzez.github.io/LearnWork/lens) and press start.
<br>This should bring you onto google lens. You can press K then L to close the tab and O then P to disguise the tab incase you are about to get caught. This only works on computers
